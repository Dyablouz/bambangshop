## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1

1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber
is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns,
do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model
struct is enough?

In Head First Design Patterns book, the Observer is an interface because the Publisher needs to call an update() method on local objects. Using an interface allows the Publisher to be connected, it doesn't care what class the observer is, as long as it implements update().

However, in Bambangshop, the Observers (Subscribers) aren't local objects sitting in the same memory space. They are completely separate web applications running on different ports. Our Publisher communicates over the network via HTTP POST requests. Therefore, we don't need a trait in Rust to handle different object types locally. We only need a simple data container (a struct) to hold the information required to make that web request.

2. id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your
understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently
use is necessary for this case?

By using Vec (list), it means that everytime we need to find the unique url, we need to iterate through the list one by one which will result in a compleixity of O(n). On th other hand, by using DashMap (map/dictionary), the lookup, insertion and deletion will all only take O(1) operations which is drastically faster. For this case, using DashMap will be better.

3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a
thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we
used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your
understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton
pattern instead?

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. In our code, we are implementing a Singleton pattern to create a single, globally accessible SUBSCRIBERS database.

However, simply making something a Singleton does not make it thread-safe. If multiple requests try to add or remove subscribers from our Singleton at the exact same time, it will cause a data race. We need DashMap inside our Singleton because it acts like a standard HashMap wrapped in concurrent locking mechanisms. It ensures that multiple threads can read and write to our Singleton safely.
